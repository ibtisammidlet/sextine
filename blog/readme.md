Consider this blog:

http://rehmansaad.blogspot.com/

When you hover over the Older Posts link, you get this link:

http://rehmansaad.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2015-04-13T02:46:00-04:00&max-results=20

And as you see, it says max-results=20, and currently you're seeing 20 posts per page, so being the smart guy that you are, you look at all the labels, and count the number of posts there are in every year, and total them. Let's say they are 213. Then you manually this url:

http://rehmansaad.blogspot.com/search?max-results=213

But when you goto that link, you see that only 55 posts are displayed, and there's still a Older Posts button. That's because Blogger at one time doesn't serve pages larger than 1 MB, in case of the said blog 55 posts made 1 MB. So you can click on the Older Posts link, and see the next 55 posts. Hence in about 4 pages (4 MB) you can see the entire blog.

This is as close as you get to it :)
